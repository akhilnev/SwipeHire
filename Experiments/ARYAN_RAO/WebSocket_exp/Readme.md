For this example, the user has two options to connect to the public chat room

2. Run the adroid app in Client_Android folder

To run the server on your local machine to test the public chat room, you 
1. Run the server in intelliJ normally (refer to the guide on how to change Java + Springboot version if there are any problems)
2. Execute the command 'java -jar websocketServer.jar' in the terminal to run the included .jar server (for frontend students)
